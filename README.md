I started to work in the computer science area three years ago. I did a system administrator professional development (CFGS in Spain) and after some time I changed to the development area. I realized that I can't stay just in one area, I like to do and learn a lot of different things.

I had more than two years working as Backend Developer. I started working mainly with the Perl language and after a big migration of technology and services I used PHP and Python where I had the opportunity of learn a lot and grow up.

I'm currently working with the Code Reliability Engineering team improving the CI systems (and other areas) of the Openstack infrastructure both upstream and downstream.
