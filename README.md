Hey! :) 

I'm Adri, a Software Engineer with a strong DevOps soul, working at Red Hat for almost 3 years on different projects and previously working as a DevOps & Perl developer automating different Linux services and internal tools across an entire hosting company. 

Passionate for traveling, food, and immersion into different cultures and languages, as fluently speaks Español, English, Galego, Italiano, and now learning some Turkçe.

Let's connect and explore new possibilities!
