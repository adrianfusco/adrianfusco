Hey! :) I'm Adri, a Software Engineer with a strong DevOps background.

I started my journey as a web PHP Backend Developer working on several frameworks and then continued to the world of Linux services automation using Perl and Python.

As my career progressed, I transitioned into a software engineer, simultaneously working on diverse projects including automation, monitoring, CI/CD, testing among others.

Beyond coding, I have a passion for traveling and food, and I love to immerse myself in different cultures. This enthusiasm extends to languages, as I fluently speak Español, English, Galego, Italiano, and now learning some Turkçe.

In every project I work on, I bring not only technical proficiency but also a commitment speed and efficiency.

Let's connect and explore new possibilities!
